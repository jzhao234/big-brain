  Run the weekly review of the big-brain second brain: triage the inbox, walk
  active projects, reschedule or drop overdue tasks, check vault health, and
  write a review summary. Use when the user types /weekly, or asks for a "weekly
  review", "review my projects", "clean up my brain", "triage my inbox".

# weekly

A guided review of the big-brain vault (whichever `big-brain` resolves — `BIG_BRAIN_VAULT`, `--vault`, or nearest `brain.config.json`). Work through it *with* the user — propose, confirm, act. The outcome: an empty inbox, honest project statuses, a task list that reflects reality, and a written record.

## Order of operations

1. **Snapshot.** `big-brain status` + `big-brain doctor`. Lead with the two or three things that most need attention (overdue tasks, stale projects, inbox pileup, broken links).
2. **Inbox triage.** For each note in the inbox, propose exactly one destination: merge into an existing note/project, become a new linked note, become tasks, or archive. Batch the proposals, get one confirmation, execute, archive the processed captures.
3. **Project walk.** For each `active` project: last Log entries, open tasks, blockers. Ask the one question that matters: *is this still active?* Update statuses (`big-brain project status <ref> paused|done|dropped`) — a shorter honest list beats an impressive stale one. For projects untouched for 2+ weeks, suggest a concrete next task or a status change.
4. **Task hygiene.** Overdue tasks get one of: do-this-week (new due date), someday (drop the date), or dead (remove). Never let a due date silently roll forward twice — that's a signal the task is mis-scoped or unwanted; say so.
5. **Doctor fixes.** Fix broken wikilinks and duplicate names found in step 1 where the fix is obvious; list the rest.
6. **Consolidate.** The doctor's `bloated-note` and `possible-duplicate` findings are the queue; `big-brain related <note>` shows what a note overlaps with. Propose (never apply unconfirmed): **split** a bloated note's grown sections into linked notes; **merge** near-duplicates into one canonical note (archive the loser, keep its title as an alias); **prune stale facts** — while reading project notes in step 3, flag statements that no longer hold (old statuses, superseded decisions, dead links to reality) and update or strike them. One batch of proposals, user confirms, execute. Memory that never gets consolidated rots; this step is why the vault stays trustworthy.
7. **Write the record.** Append a short summary to today's daily note Log: projects reviewed, status changes, inbox items processed, consolidations made, what the user said matters next week. If the vault has git auto-commit enabled, the review's edits commit and push on their own; otherwise commit at the end (`git -C <vault> add -A && git commit -m "weekly review <date>" && git push`).

## Tone

This is a working meeting, not a report. Short exchanges, concrete proposals, sensible defaults ("I'd archive these three — objections?"). The user's time budget is ~10 minutes; don't stretch it.
